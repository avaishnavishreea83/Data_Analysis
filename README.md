Project Summary
"My Diwali Sales Data Analysis project aimed to uncover patterns in customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and product preferences to help guide targeted marketing and product strategies."

Tools Used

* Python: I used Python as the main programming language for data handling, loading, and cleaning the dataset, which allowed me to process data quickly and efficiently.
* Seaborn: Seaborn was used for data visualization, allowing me to create graphs that revealed purchasing patterns, popular regions, and top product categories. Visualizations made the analysis more accessible and highlighted key insights clearly.
  
Key Findings

Demographics: Most buyers were females aged 26-35, especially from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, who also had a higher purchasing power than men.
Top Customers: Married women working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors had the highest spending, particularly in Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.
Regional Sales: The states with the highest sales were Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka, showing a strong concentration of customers in these areas.

Project Outcome

Audience Targeting: Based on the findings, businesses could target married women aged 26-35 from these regions and industries with specific marketing campaigns.
Product Focus: With Food, Clothing, and Electronics showing the highest popularity, businesses could prioritize these categories in future sales efforts.
